# Section 1: Scripting and Automation
## Task 1: Write a Bash script that does the following:
- Creates a backup of a specified directory.
- Compresses the backup with gzip.
- Appends the current date to the backup file name.
- Moves the backup file to a specified backup directory.

## Instructions:
1. The script should take two arguments: the directory to back up and the backup
directory.
2. Ensure the script handles errors appropriately (e.g., the specified directory does not
exist).
